DESCRIPTION
    Script to make it easier to install and used the excellent local::lib
    perl module. For more information about local::lib please see:

        http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib

    This tool is designed to make it easier to install and manage multiple
    local::lib setups. However, the tool itself is relatively easy to setup,
    you may wish to read and follow the instructions linked about.

    This script performs two services: 1) provides a single commandline
    script which can be used to install multiple local::libs, 2) provides a
    helper script which you can use to initialize an installed local::lib
    for a given command

EXAMPLES
    ALl examples assume you have the file 'bootstrap-locallib.pl' downloaded
    into a directory in your $PATH, and that it's been set to executable.

    Deploy a local::lib to $HOME/local-lib5 for the default interpreter

        bootstrap-locallib.pl

    Deploy a local::lib to $HOME/myapp-local-lib5

        bootstrap-locallib.pl affix="myapp-local-lib5"

    Deploy a local::lib to /usr/local/lib/myapp-local-lib6

        bootstrap-locallib.pl basedir="/usr/local/lib" affix="myapp-local-lib5"

    Invoke helper created in the above example to initialize local::lib for
    the current shell.

        /usr/local/lib/bin/localenv perl -V

    You may wish to invoke the helper from your shell .profile or create an
    alias to assist you further.
